# 1. Introduction

Provide a short description of the software being specified. Describe its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals.

The software will be a web application that will enhance the recruitment process for undergraduate student assistants in the Computer Science Department. The purpose is to facilitate connections between the students that want to be an SA for a class, and the instructors looking to find student assistants. Efficiency is a large benefit for the program, as the recruitment process was carried out mostly manually in the past. Management is another benefit, as it will be easy for the professors to manage their potential student assistants. Overall, the goal of the application is to improve on the recruitment process, offering an efficient, user-friendly application. 


----
# 2. Requirements Specification

This section specifies the software product's requirements. Specify all of the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a software system to satisfy those requirements, and to enable testers to test that the software system satisfies those requirements.

1.Students and professors can create accounts and input profile information (system must require authentication)
- Must be able to log in using their unique username and password to securely access the platform.
- for students, profile information includes name, email major; for professors, profile information includes name, department, contact details
3. Professors must have the ability to create, view, and manage SA positions (ex: assign students as SA) for their courses.
4. Students must be able to browse open SA positions, apply to relevant positions, and withdraw applications if they are no longer interested.
5. Professors must be able to create course sections and view list of students in a course and their qualifications
6. System should inform professor when course limit has been reached

## 2.1 Customer, Users, and Stakeholders

A brief description of the customer, stakeholders, and users of your software.

The users and stakeholders of this application will be instructors and students at WPI. Student users are students who are looking for a Student Assistant role in a WPI course while instructor users are professors who are looking to hire Student Assistants for a course section they are teaching.

----
## 2.2 User Stories
This section will include the user stories you identified for your project. Make sure to write your user stories in the form :

## 2.3 Use Cases

This section will include the specification for your project in the form of use cases. 

Group the related user stories and provide a use case for each user story group. You don't need to draw the use-case diagram for the use cases; you will only provide the textual descriptions.  **Also, you don't need to include the use cases for "registration" and "login" use cases for both student and faculty users.**

  * First, provide a short description of the actors involved (e.g., regular user, administrator, etc.) and then follow with a list of the use cases.
  * Then, for each use case, include the following:

    * Name,
    * Participating actors,
    * Entry condition(s) (in what system state is this use case applicable),
    * Exit condition(s) (what is the system state after the use case is done),
    * Flow of events (how will the user interact with the system; list the user actions and the system responses to those),
    * Alternative flow of events (what are the exceptional cases in the flow of events and they will be handles)
    * Iteration # (which sprint do you plan to work on this use case) 

Each use case should also have a field called "Iteration" where you specify in which iteration you plan to implement this feature.

You may use the following table template for your use cases. Copy-paste this table for each use case you will include in your document.
